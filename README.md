# WonderCMS Bootstrap 5 theme
### Author: Joaquim Homrighausen
(https://github.com/joho1968)

Simple Bootstrap 5 theme, inspired by "Simple Material inspired theme" by @tunguskha.

This theme does **not** contain the actual Bootstrap 5 files since I believe in modular design and resource distribution.

The [WCMS-BS5-LOCAL plugin for WonderCMS](https://github.com/joho1968/wcms-bs5-local) plugin comes with Bootstrap 5.x and will serve Bootstrap 5.x files from your web server.

:warning: This theme is not compatible with the SummerNote editor plugin for WonderCMS, since it automatically includes Bootstrap from some CDN.

## Preview

## How to use
1. Download the wcms-bs5*.zip file
2. Unpack its contents in the `themes/` folder of your WonderCMS site
3. Make sure you remove any folder prefix like `-1.0.0` of the unpacked folder
4. Edit the `data/files/database.js` file and change the theme to `wcms-bs5`
